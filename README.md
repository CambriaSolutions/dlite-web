## Setup

For development and test, the application uses `.env` files to populate
the environmental variables. And we use envars to ensure 12 factor
portability for our apps!

To setup your local environment copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env`:

    cp .env.sample .env

## Start the app

It is just an express app, and runs via a nmp script:

    npm start

## Development

1. Clone this repo
2. Start contributing

## Testing

Unit/integration tests are via [mocha](https://mochajs.org/). If using the `assert`
module is too low level. Feel free to add in some `chai` and `sinon`.

These tests can be run via an npm script:

    `npm run test:server`
