Feature: Customer asked about vetran status and ID
  As a DMV Customer who is a vetran
  I want to have the option of getting a veteran's id
  And to get more information about veteran's services
  So that I can sign up for benefits unique to veterans

 

    # And I visit the veteran services page
    # Then I will see the section heading for my history
    # And I will see that the "Next" button is disabled
    # When I click No for veteran
    # Then I will see that the "Next" button is no longer disabled
