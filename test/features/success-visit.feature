Feature: Confirmation Page
  As a DMV Customer
  I want to prepare for my in-person visit
  so that I will schedule and confirm my visit and be able to complete my transaction during my visit

  Scenario: Seeing the empty form
    Given I go to the new online DL application page
    And I visit success visit page
    Then I see text for documents needed for a Class C license
