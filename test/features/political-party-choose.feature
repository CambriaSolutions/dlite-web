  so that I choose to go into the party preference information or skip it

    Given I go to the new online DL application page
    When I visit the political party choose page
    And I will see that the Continue button is disabled

    Then I will see that the Continue button is no longer disabled

    And I go to the page with my summary
    Then I will see Yes for my political party choice
